			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to improve our programming skills by using JavaScript in the developer console. We declared arrays and objects, as well as referenced them. Then in the JavaScript file we were challenged to declare the variables again and then output them neatly. Lastly, we were asked to organize and stylize the file/webpage using HTML and CSS, and include a photo.  </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had minor issues in the console that were all punctuation related. I wasn't using commas after make/model (etc.) and it didn't like that. We struggled to link Kai's JavaScript file. I don't know why it wasn't working so I deleted his linking code lines and rewrote it and it started working. I don't know what the issue was.  </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You're looking at my file bookie! And I have arrays and objects declared in JavaScript.</p>
