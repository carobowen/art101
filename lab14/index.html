                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p> The challenge of this lab was to debug old JavaScript assignments with a partner. </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I decided to edit lab 9, which was mainly regarding jquery. At first, my local changes were not showing up but it was because I was following the link to the published website instead of the file. </p>
            </div>

        
            <div class="minor-section">
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>  The results were a nicer looking lab 9, similar to this one, with working buttons. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>At first, I checked the console, which reported no issues. After that, I went through my HTML to ensure that the structure was correct and that the IDs in the JavaScript matched the IDs in the HTML and verified that the IDs #challenge, #Problems, and #Results were correctly assigned to the respective div elements. My original code incorrectly targeted elements by IDs that didn't exist in the HTML or were incorrectly named. To fix this, I corrected the jQuery selectors to append buttons to the correct div elements by their IDs (#challenge, #Problems, #Results). Additionally, I had used duplicate IDs for buttons, which is invalid in HTML. To fix this, I assigned unique IDs to each button (#button-challenge, #button-problems, #button-results). I also realized that I used the incorrect selector $("button-challenge") (missing # for ID selector). I changed the selector to $("#button-challenge") to correctly target the button by its ID. Then, I ensured the toggleClass function toggled the "special" class on the correct section and verified that toggleClass("special") was applied to the correct sections: #challenge, #Problems, and #Results. The original event handlers for p elements were correct but needed to be placed inside the document ready function. Lastly, I made sure that the event handlers for mouseenter, mouseleave, and click events on p elements were inside the $(document).ready() function for proper initialization.</p>
