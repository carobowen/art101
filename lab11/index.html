                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with JS events. We were tasked with creating our own HTML, CSS, and JS files and we were also asked to add an event listener with a callbacks.</p>

                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>When I first checked my webpage, everything showed up correctly but the button didn't do anything. I first went to the console, which told me there were issues with my CSS and JS links. After editing those, the button still was not working, and the console then reported that certain things weren't defined. I went back to my JS file and made it so everything was in one block except for the function and my button worked after that.</p>

                        <p>The result of this lab was an input bar with a button attached that rearranged the letters in the input alphabetically.  </p>
