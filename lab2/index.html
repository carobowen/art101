				<h1>Hello World</h1>
				<p>My name is Caroline and I don't have a partner for this lab. I study anthropology, which is niche, but also very broad at the same time.I enjoy reading, creative journaling, and snuggling with my cat Fig. I minor in Spanish and hope to move to Spain in the Fall.   </p>
				<p> I actually ended up partnering with Kai, who is a 3rd year sociology major</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of the lab is to create an organized html file that is stylized using CSS</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? <p>

					</p> I struggled significantly to get my CSS code to run smoothly. It took several tries to get the background colors to change and to change the size and font of the text. I honestly just messed around with it until it worked, a lot of the time the error was small, like a misplaced space or spelling error, or using a colon instead of a semi-colon, but the biggest error was using the wrong tag. It was especially difficult trying to link the CSS file, I think what I ended up doing was moving the link around until it was placed correctley.   </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p> This assignment went okay. I felt really discouraged because my partner decided to work with somebody else and I didn't have enough time to find someone else to work with. I also struggled because there was no in-person lecture regarding CSS, so I kind of went in blind, although I did consult the lecture slides for help. Overall the most helpful tool was looking at the codes in the example assignments. I put a lot of effort into this assignment as I completed the whole thing by myself and consulted multiple online resources for assistance. </p>
					<p> *Edit: I actually was able to get another partner,Kai, after completing the assignment mostly by myself</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to change the text on this webpage, as well as the size of the text and its font. I also changed the background colors to pink and yellow. I changed the color of the title to yellow as well. </p>
