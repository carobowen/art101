					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to properly use functions to sort an array and convert arrays to strings. Additionally, we had to create our own folders for this lab with new code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled the most with creating the folders. I didn't know how to make it so that the file would show up as a file, but after some rearranging I was able to get them running. Other than that, things ran pretty smoothly afterwards, the function was pretty straightforward.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The results were a question pop up that asks for your name and then rearranges the letter from it on the webpage</p>
