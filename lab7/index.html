					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was/is to work within the console with JavaScript. Additionally, we were asked to add comments in the JavaScript file, link the JavaScript file, and go about our usual work which is to utilize the HTML and CSS files as well.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled to link JS file. I typed it out exactly as it was in the example in the assignment and consulted Kai's code to see if there was a difference between his and mine but we couldn't find it. After giving up and then coming back we discovered it was because I had put spaces where they weren't needed in my JavaScript file. So annoying.

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The results of this lab were me figuring out how to effectively use the console, understanding how to establish variables, and do arithmetic in it. I was able to link my JS file, an image and some CSS.</p>
