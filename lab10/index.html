                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulations. We were  tasked with creating the HTML, CSS, and JS files. In the JavaScript we were asked to create a helper function and event listener for our button. </p>

                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p> Originally, my button did nothing and the output showed up independently of the button. I went to the console and it said there were issues with the JS link and the CSS. I first edited the JS so that steps 3 through 4 of task 3 were all connected via indendation. Then, I added the CSS from Wes's templates that are available on their website. The button worked after that. </p>

                        <p> The result of this lab was a basic webpage with a button that generates latin text. </p>
