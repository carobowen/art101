                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had several issues with my JavaScript. I tried manually writing the code from the screenshot on the assignment but nothing showed up. I checked the console and it said that the event listener was null, so I deleted all the code and copied the code from Wes's website found under JS source. Once again, nothing showed up so I checked the console, and it was an issue with the event listener again. After that I copied my javascript into chat gpt and asked it to fix it and it did. </p>
