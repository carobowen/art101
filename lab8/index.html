					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with the map function using callback functions. To do this, we were required to create an array and a corresponding function. After that, we were asked to test the function. Additionally, we were asked to use a callback function to do a new operation with map. Then we set variables for the results in our JS and printed them out. </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled with the JS primarily for this lab but also with the HTML. The work I did in the console was fine until I was editing it in my JavaScript. When I went to the console on my webpage the output was wrong. It kept saying that my (isPrime) function was undefined. It took me some time to troubleshoot that because I thought I had defined it. Then when I got it working, my other funtion was showing up as undefined. To fix that, I consulted a previous screenshot of my JS file from when the output of the "undefined" function was showing up. I copied that part of the code and it started running again. The problem with my HTML was silly. My edits weren't showing up and I was really confused as to why, but then I realized that I was looking at the version I had published before I stopped working on it on Saturday, it was the wrong webpage.</p>
