					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to understand pseudocode, the reasons psuedocode is used, and the method by which we were taught pseudocode. Additionally, task 4 encourages us to use knowledge from previous assignments to improve the end webpage.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We struggled with where in the HTML to place the pre-code. We weren't sure if Wes wanted it displayed on the webpage or if it was only meant to be placed in the HTML and that's it. 
						I also had a hard time with the CSS. When I tried adding classes and ID's to the HTML they always turned red. </p>
